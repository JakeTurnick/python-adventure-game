#prompt/theme -You wreck car - your location is a winding country road. 
## car tire is popped, windshield is broken, 




print("You slowly come too, you've been unconsious for some time. How long, you're not sure.  ")


print("You look around. You're in your car but you've wrecked. All you remember is you heard a 'pop' and you lost control. It seems a tree limb pierced the windshield, cracking it.")

    print("Would you like to inpsect yourself or the car first?")

## promt user for choice 

        #player_choice = input("")

        ##Choice: Inspect self: 
        print("Your head hurts, you believe you have a concusion. Your thoughts are foggy and it's difficult to complete a coherent thought. You have a small gash on your forehead. The bleeding has almost stopped. You should find a gauze to wrap around the wound")
       
        #OR....
       
# Clearly defined keys to win
        print("A branch pierced your windshiled. The front passenger side tired is popped. You notice coolant on the bumper and a wet spot on the ground")

        print("You pop the hood and notice that your radiator is punctured. Luckily you are well versed in car mechanics. You know how to replace the radiator")

##Choice: call for help. Who do you call first? 

    print("You grab your cellphone and are going to call for help. Who do you call first? ")

    print("Your cousins tow truck service, 911 for an ambulance, or your wife Linda?")

            #each choice gives the same answer
            print("ring.... ring.... ring....")
            # sleep each ring, <.5sec
            print("No answer.")

    -!idea!- if you call your wife (You can try and call your wife at any time in the game. Hidden lore later?)

            print("ring... ring... ring...")
            print("Hey it's Linda, sorry I can't come to the phone right now. Leave a message and I will call you back as soon as I can!")

#Choice: Wait or walk? 
    print("No one answers. Do you wait for help to hopefully come by? You're not far from the town. Do you walk to town? ")

    #Choice wait: 
    print("You sit in your car and wait for help. You wait... and wait. You check your phone, it's been over and hour and no one has driven up or down the road. How strange.... ")

#Choice walk:
print("You walk to town. You notice while you walk that the weather is strangely foggy. Which seems strange for this time of year. As you draw nearer towards the town, the fog becomes more and more dense.")

print("The fog feels like it has it's own will. Like it's watching you. It envelops you. You swear that you see little shadows dancing in the fog. You can hardly see your own hand in front of you. You must be getting close to the town. You've lived here all your life. You know that by now you should be seeing buildings.")

print("Just as quick as the fog descended upon you, the dense fog seems to almost vanish. It thins out as you enter the town. The fog seems to thinly hang around on the ground now. You look back and see the thick fog wall behind you. Your head throbs and your vision is blurry. You look for help but... no one is around?")

#Choice: look around? Or head to the nearest pharmacy?
